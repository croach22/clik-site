      <p class="text-xs text-brand-cream/30">Effective Date: June 22, 2023</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for using Clik, a platform ("App") provided by Clik Photos Inc. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us through the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. By using the App, you agree to the terms and practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-cream pt-4">Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Personal Information:</strong> When you use the App, we collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. This includes but is not limited to your name, phone number, email address, and a profile photo. The profile photo is used for facial recognition purposes within the App to identify and tag photos associated with your account.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-cream pt-4">Use of Information</h2>

      <p>
        2.1. <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Personal Information:</strong> We collect personal information to provide, maintain, and improve the functionality of the App, including features such as facial recognition for photo tagging.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2. <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Selfies and Profile Information:</strong> We may utilize your selfie and profile information to notify you if you appear in photos taken at events, even if you are not aware that Clik is supporting the photography at a particular event. For instance, if you sign up for Clik at Event A and later attend Event B, we may notify you if you appear in photos taken at Event B.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3. <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Event photos:</strong> Depending on the scenario and the arrangements made between event hosts, photographers, and guests, the ownership and usage rights of event photos may vary:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Event Hosts Owning Photos:</strong> (i) When event hosts pay the photographer upfront for their services, the event hosts own the photos taken at the event. However, while guests are allowed to download and use the photos for personal purposes, they do not own the photos. The event hosts retain the ownership rights. (ii) In this scenario, Clik, the photographer, and the event organizer (if applicable) have the right to use the event photos for non-competitive purposes, such as marketing or promotional activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Photographer's Ownership and Guest Purchases:</strong> (i) In some cases, photographers may be shooting at will and selling photos directly to event goers. In this scenario, the photographer retains the ownership rights to the photos until they are purchased by guests. (ii) Once guests purchase the photos, they obtain ownership rights to those specific photos. However, it is important to note that Clik, the photographer, and the event organizer (if applicable) have the right to use the photos for non-competitive purposes, such as marketing or promotional activities, even after they are purchased by guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the specific ownership and usage arrangements for event photos may be further detailed in the terms and conditions specific to each event or as agreed upon between the relevant parties.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-cream pt-4">Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

      <p>
        3.1. <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Contact Information:</strong> We reserve the right to share your contact information, including your name and email address, with the event organizer and/or photographers with whom you engage at Clik supported events. This is to facilitate communication and coordination between event organizers and event participants. We will not share your contact information with any other third parties without your explicit consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2. <strong class="text-brand-cream/80">Profile photo:</strong> We do not share the profile photo you provide with anyone, including event hosts or photographers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-cream pt-4">Data Security</h2>

      <p>
        4.1. We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-cream pt-4">Children's Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        5.1. The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that personal information has been collected from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.
